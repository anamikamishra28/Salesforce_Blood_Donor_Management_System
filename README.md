Problem Statement

Blood donation and availability are often managed manually through registers and phone calls.

• Lack of centralized system leads to delays in finding compatible donors during emergencies.

• Miscommunication between hospitals, blood banks, and donors results in shortages.

• Difficulty in maintaining donor history, eligibility, and tracking regular donors.

• Emergency blood requests are not communicated effectively to potential donors.

• No proper reporting system to analyze donation trends and shortages.
 
Project Overview

• A centralized, automated platform for managing donors, blood inventory, and requests.

• Real-time donor matching based on blood group and location.

• Hospitals and blood banks can raise urgent blood requests and notify eligible donors instantly.

• Dashboards and reports for monitoring donor activity, blood availability, and hospital demand.

• Secure storage of donor and patient data with privacy compliance.

Objectives

• Digitize donor registration, hospital requests, and blood availability tracking.

• Provide dashboards for hospitals, blood banks, and administrators to monitor real-time data.

• Allow donors to view their donation history, eligibility, and receive alerts.

• Generate real-time alerts for urgent requests and donor reminders.

• Ensure data accuracy, privacy, and security at all levels
